<h1> Visualizer of A* Algorithm in Java with GUI</h1>

- - -

<h2> What does the app do?</h2>

The user enters a <span style="color:grey"> *weighted directed graph* </span>. The application runs the A* algorithm, visually displays the process of the algorithm *step by step*, finds <span style="color:grey"> *the shortest path* </span> from vertex A to vertex B and outputs <span style="color:grey">*its length*</span>.

<h4>Input data</h4>

<li>Weighted directed graph (created by mouse clicks / import from file)</li>

<h4>Output data</h4>

<li>Visualization of the step-by-step process of the A* algorithm <br/></li>
<li>The shortest path from A to B and its length<br/></li>

<h2>App's features</h2>
<li>Create graph by mouse clicks / import from file (adjacency matrix with weights + nodes coordinates)</li>
<li>Heuristic choice: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance and Chebyshev distance</li>
<li>Move to the next step in the algorithm and pause during rendering</li>
<li>Explanatory notes for the user</li>

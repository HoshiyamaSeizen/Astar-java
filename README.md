<h1> A* Algorithm in Java with GUI</h1>

<h2> What does the app do?</h2>

The user enters a *weighted directed graph*. The application runs the A* algorithm, visually displays the process of the algorithm *step by step*, finds *the shortest path* from vertex A to vertex B and outputs *its length*.

<h2>Input data</h2>

<li>Weighted directed graph (created by mouse clicks / import from file)</li>

<h2>Output data</h2>

<li>Visualization of the step-by-step process of the A* algorithm <br/></li>
<li>The shortest path from A to B and its length<br/></li>

<h2>App's features</h2>
<li>Create graph by mouse clicks / import from file (adjacency matrix with weights + nodes coordinates)</li>
<li>Heuristic choice: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance and Chebyshev distance</li>
<li>Move to the next step in the algorithm and pause during rendering</li>
<li>Explanatory notes for the user</li>
